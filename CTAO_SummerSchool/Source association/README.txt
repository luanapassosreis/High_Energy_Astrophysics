To be ready for the Hands-on session on source association:

- Check that you have python with astropy, matplotlib, numpy

- Retrieve the catalog files in this directory

- Retrieve the two "_empty" notebooks

- You may also install astroquery if you want to try on-line (Vizier) catalogs,
  but it is not necessary for the session
