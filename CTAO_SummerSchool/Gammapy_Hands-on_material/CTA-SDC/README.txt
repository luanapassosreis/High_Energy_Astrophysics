The `caldb` folder contains the IRF necessary to handle the SDC datasets that can be find into the folder `output`.
The `output` directory is structured so that there are the `products_SDC/Events/North` and `products_SDC/Events/South` folders with the event list for the north and south array. 
Please, be aware that the dataset is only a tiny sub-sample of the full SDC.
